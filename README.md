# DataSurveyForm
I am learning how to do an online data survey with human-interaction concepts like align patterns, not distracting, readable, and easy to use. I used all the free sources to build the data survey form; the free sources were the google cloud platform's free subscription and awardspace.net. Other references were https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18296267/form-validation-with-bootstrap-jquery, https://www.aspsnippets.com/questions/194703/Bootstrap-validation-for-Registration-Form-using-jQuery-BootstrapValidator-plugin-in-ASPNet-MVC/ ,and https://github.com/zipingH/csc642-forms/blob/master/csc642_forms/results.php, since the people had free copy-right licenses. Here is my data survey form: http://jimmysyeung.atwebpages.com. The data survey form will not save information permanently, but HTML and PHP work together enough to create an HTML with the user's input submitted information.

I got 21 out of 20 due to extra credit. I lost a point for not making names have only characters.
