# DataSurveyForm
I am learning how to make an online data survey with human-interaction concepts like align pattern, not distracting, readable, and easy to use.
I had use all the free sources to build the data survey form; the free sources were google cloud platform's free subscription and awardspace.net.
Another references were https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18296267/form-validation-with-bootstrap-jquery, https://www.aspsnippets.com/questions/194703/Bootstrap-validation-for-Registration-Form-using-jQuery-BootstrapValidator-plugin-in-ASPNet-MVC/ ,and https://github.com/zipingH/csc642-forms/blob/master/csc642_forms/results.php, since the people had free copy-right licenses.
Here was my data survey form: [http://jimmysyeung.atwebpages.com](http:jimmysyeung.atwebpages.com). The data survey form will not save information pernamently, but html and php works together enough to create a html with submitted information from the user's input.
